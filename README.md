# CacheDOS

## Setup

### Initialize submodules

	$ git submodule update --init
	$ git submodule update --remote

### Make benchmarks and kernel modules
	
	$ cd IsolBench/bench; make; cd ../../
	$ cd memguard; make; cd ..
	$ cd base-memguard; make; cd ..

## Evaluation

### Recreate a specific figure

Move the Fig# subdirectory (replace # with the figure's numeric value):

	$ cd figures/Fig#/
	$ sudo ./run.sh

### Recreate all figures

	$ cd figures
	$ sudo ./run-tests.sh


Note that Figure 5 requires that the kernel be patched with PALLOC. For
patching instructions please refer to [https://github.com/heechul/palloc](https://github.com/heechul/palloc).

## Figure creation

Copy results into figures/figure-results.csv (must be done manually),
specifically in columns B through E. Once all the results are copied
columns G through K will contain the data to be copied to the corresponding
.dat files. The file to place the data in will by the cells beginning with a '#'.

A single Figure can be created by going to the figures Fig# directory and running:

	$ gnuplot gen.gp

All figures can be generated by running:

	$ ./gen-figures

From the figures directory.
